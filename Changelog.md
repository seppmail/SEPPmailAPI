# Changelog of the SEPPmailAPI PowerShell Module

## Version 1.0.5

### Find-SMAUser

- ***Breaking Change***: Find-SMAUser now has the -list parameter default to $true, which means only the e-mail addresses are returned.
- ***Breaking Change***: Removed pipeline capability of Find-SMAUser, because it should be used to query and filter specific users with low DB-impact. For a deeper user analysis use Get-SMAUser, which stays pipeline-aware and emits full objects.
- Add -limit parameter to limit the output of the query. by default its "0" which means no limit, -limit 50 would limit to 50 entries. 
- Add -uid parameter to filter for specific UIDÂ´s
- Add -partialMatch parameter to filter for parts of the e-mail address. john.doe@contoso.eu may be filtered by -partialMatch 'conto' or -emailPattern 'john'
- Add -Name parameter to search for Names (works with parts of the name also) like -Name 'john' ==> john.doe@contoso.eu
- Add -active parameter to filter by active or locked users with -active:$true or -active:$false
- Add 4 Parametersets to filter by email, patternMatch, name or uid.
- Add examples in the synopsis to show those examples for Get-Help.

## Version 1.0.4

All features of API Version 1.0.2 are implemented.
